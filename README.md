# STEM-MS-Statement-Of-Purpose

These are some of the statements of purpose I used to apply to Complex Systems and Data Science programs. I was accepted into Vermont, SDSU, and Chalmers and rejected by Stanford and Boulder (that one was PhD). Unfortunately I can't find my Chalmers one anymore.

I hope somebody gets some use out of these, as looking at other peoples' certainly helped me immensely.
